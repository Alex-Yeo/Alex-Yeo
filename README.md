## Hi there 👋

Hi! My name is Alex Yeo (he/him). I'm currently a sophomore at Montgomery Blair High School in Maryland.
I'm interested in sports data science, machine learning, website design, and data visualizations. 

Looking for any opportunity to expand my knowledge and hope to make a difference in the future!
My dream is to win a World Series as the general manager of a Major League Baseball team.

**Skills:**
- Python
  - Pandas
  - pyTorch
  - pyBaseball
- Java
- C++
- Lots of childhood Scratch projects!

Currently working on starting up a personal github
Currently learning applications and inner-workings of Artificial Intelligence
Ask me about who I think will win the World Series this year

## Hi there 👋

Hi! My name is Alex Yeo (he/him). I'm currently a sophomore at Montgomery Blair High School in Maryland. <br>
I'm interested in sports data science, machine learning, website design, and data visualizations. 

Looking for any opportunity to expand my knowledge and hope to make a difference in the future. <br>
My dream is to win a World Series as the general manager of a Major League Baseball team. <br>

- I'm currently working on starting up a personal github
- I'm currently learning applications and inner-workings of Artificial Intelligence
- How to reach me: through my [email](alexanderyeo809@gmail.com)
- Ask me about who I think will win the World Series this year

<br>

**Skills:**
- Python
  - Pandas
  - pyTorch
  - pyBaseball
- Java
- C++
- Lots of childhood Scratch projects!
